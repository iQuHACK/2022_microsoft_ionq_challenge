## Quantum Maze Game
Version: 1.0.0

Team: The Seekers


The Quantum Maze is a classical ludo inspired maze game that allows beginners to delve into the basic concepts of different quantum gates. This project is jointly developed by Utkarsh Singh, lakshika Rathi and Akhilesh Dubey. 


The dice roll is symbolised as a quantum measurement of a circuit with two hadamard gates. The winning move involves applying a suitable quantum gate to a bloch sphere to bring it back to state 0. Unlike general Ludo games, our dice has only 4 states. 

Package Requirements: 

Qiskit

Azure Quantum - To access the IonQ backend

Also compatible with:

IBM backends

This game needs a shot based quantum machine as well as a statevector simulator to generate states for the Bloch Sphere. 

Even for the IonQ device we need an AER simulator available in QisKit library.
